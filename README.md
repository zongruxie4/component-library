# C3 - the CLAIMED Component Compiler

**TL;DR**
- takes arbitrary assets (Jupyter notebooks, python scripts, R scripts) as input
- automatically creates container images and pushes to container registries
- automatically installs all required dependencies into the container image
- creates KubeFlow Pipeline components (target workflow execution engines are pluggable)
- creates Kubernetes job configs for execution on Kubernetes/Openshift clusters
- can be triggered from CICD pipelines
